# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H).


## Overview

I did this exercise mostly to see how I could do without much help. I wasn't shooting for a pixel perfect solution and didn't pay for the sFigma file.

CSS has always been a weak point for me and I've been interested in becoming more of a full stack developer, so I'm giving these small challenges a shot. I think it turned out pretty ok.

### What I learned

That I still understand the basics of CSS. As I get into more complicated challenges, I'll need to look into things that I'm really weak on, like Flexbox, CSS Grid, and responsive design.
